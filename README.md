# tic-tac-toe-vanillaJS

a simple client sided game in vanilla javascript
the game starts with the turn of player X
after each turn the other player gets their turn to play
the game follows the rules of tic tac toe
a button at the bottom of the page called 'New Game' is clicked to reset the game without page reload
there are two paragraph tags, one that reveals the game status and the other shows which player's turn it is to play
both are just above the 3x3 grid, where the match takes place
